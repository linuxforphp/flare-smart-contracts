# Attack Vectors

This file will be used for any research around attack vectors.

## Resources
- Attack list for distributing the work amongst our team is [here](https://blog.sigmaprime.io/solidity-security.html). Lists AV (attack vectors) by name. Gives a clear example for each AV.

- Consensys known attacks [list](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/known_attacks/). Well maintained list with many relevant neauncens per attack.

please only add high value resources and write a short orientation note stating the contents and added value of this resource.

## Best practice lists
- Consensys security best practices [here](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/recommendations/)

## Reviewed Attacks

A list of attacks one of the devs reviewed against existing code base.
- Please add comments per attack

#### Re Entrancy attack - Alen

One of problematic things with reentry attacks is discrepancy between the actuall system currency amount on the contract and the balance maintained in the variable(s) in the contract (e.g. DAO hack).
One efficient remedy is verification differences before and the end of an execution of a sensitive API call.
See (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomp.2021.598780/full)

#### Default Visiblities - Chuck

#### UnExpected Ether (FLR) - Jan

#### Arithmentic over / under flow - Bostjan


#### DelegateCall and default visibility - Ilan

Two separate issues that can create hidden attacks.
 - Default visibility is public. must be aware and always set visiblity.
 - DelegateCall can potentially reach any function in calling contract.

 The discussed attacks are not relevant to our code:
  - we don't use libraries that are contracts. No conflicting storage positions.
  - Default visibility should fail with linter.
