/**
 * @title Reward Services library
 * @notice A library to manage a collection of reward services, their associated totals, and to perform operations
 *   that impact or involve the collection, such as calculating topup amounts across services.
 * @dev There are two concepts that are helpful to understand. A sharing percentage associates an inflation receiver
 *   with a sharing percentage used to calculate percentage of authorized inflation a given reward contract
 *   is entitled to receive for distributing rewards. A reward service is associtated to a topup configuration, which
 *   dictates how much FLR will be minted and sent for claiming reserves, and it stores totals for a given inflation
 *   receiver, for a given annum.
